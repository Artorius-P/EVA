# EVA
The Ethereum Virtual Agent (EVA) is a program designed to communicate with Ethereum peers and collect Ethereum transactions on the P2P network without block sync. It acts like a real node but cannot verify transactions.
~~This project aims to make it simple for anyone to become an EVA pilot.~~
